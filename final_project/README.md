Star Wars Tie Fighter - Graphics 4229 Final Project
============

## Edward Zhu - Undergrad

####Time it took to get this far: **50hours-ish**

## Idea

Created a detailed TIE Fighter from Star Wars flying around in space with rocks floating around it and making it able to shoot lasers from it's canons.

Tested and working without errors/warnings on MAC OSX 10.11.1.

## How to build

1. Run `make`
2. Run `./final`

## Main Key bindings:
 *  SPACEBAR   - SHOOT LASERS!!
 *  + or -     - Change field of view of perspective
 *  arrows     - Change view angle
 *  d/D        - Zoom in and out
 *  0          - Reset view angle to (0,0)
 *  ESC        - Exit

## What was hard & what Remains to be done:
 *  Creating the TIE fighter and making sure all points were created perfectly was very, very time consuming.
 *  MOVEMENT in general took a while; the rock movements took a while to code out the right procedure that wouldn't wreck the FPS. Also the lasers to trigger off a spacebar took me a while to finally get working and right.
 *  **WHAT IS LEFT:** The lighting is a little bit off, so I will try to figure that out. The backdrop doesn't look perfect either. And if I have more time, I want to add more details to the rocks and the to TIE fighter to make it more pretty.
