# Projections - HW4
## Edward Zhu
## CSCI 4229

Many basic functions used throughout inspired and influenced from ex9 example package on Moodle.
Slightly modified from my 3D Objects code, and added first person mode, which took so long.

Time it took to complete: **5 hours**

## Idea

I created a neighborhood of houses located around a corner. You can also walk around it in with first person mode

## How to build

1. Run `make`
2. Run `./hw4`

## Key bindings:

- Arrows in first person mode move you forwards/backwards, and rotate you left and right
- w/s: move up and down, first person mode only
- UP ARROW: Rotate X axis +
- DOWN ARROW: Rotate X axis -
- LEFT ARROW: Rotate Y axis +
- RIGHT ARROW: Rotate Y axis -
- m: Toggle between projection mode
- Page Up and down: Zoom in and out
- +/-: Changes field of view for perspective
- ESC: Exit
- 0: hard reset
